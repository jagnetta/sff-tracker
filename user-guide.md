## Important Things to Remember

### About the Streets
- **"All"** means both sides of the street
- Pay attention to house numbers (like "odd numbers only")
- Some routes say "from Main St to Oak St" - this tells you where to start and stop
- Follow the directions exactly so you don't miss houses

### What the Numbers Mean
- Each route tells you how many door hangers you need
- Pick routes that match how much time you have
- More door hangers = more time needed

- Click "Start Over" to go back to picking areas
- You can add more routes anytime before the food drive
