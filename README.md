### Data Management Architecture

#### Route Assignment Tracking
- **Node.js Backend**: An Express.js server handles all data persistence.
- **`RouteTracker` Class**: A client-side class that communicates with the backend API to manage assignments.
- **Persistent Storage**: Route assignments are stored in `database.json` on the server, ensuring data is shared across all users and sessions.
- **Assignment Prevention**: The backend logic prevents routes assigned to one user from being available to others.
- **User Identification**: Tracks assignments by Last Name + Unit combination.
- **Assignment Removal**: Users can remove their own assignments, which sends a request to the server to make the route available again.

#### Data Structure
Routes are structured as:
```javascript
{
    routeId: "1-1",                    // Unique identifier (region-number)
    name: "WASHINGTON ST.",            // Route designation
    flyerCount: 200,                   // Number of flyers to distribute
    description: "Street descriptions..." // Detailed route coverage
}
```

Assignments track:
```javascript
{
    lastName: "Smith",                 // User's last name
    unit: "Troop 40",                 // Scout unit
    timestamp: "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z" // Assignment date/time
}
```

### State Management & Flow Control

#### Authentication Flow
1. **Entry Point**: `index.html` routes users based on authentication status stored in `sessionStorage`.
2. **Login Required**: Unauthenticated users are directed to `login.html`.
3. **Role-Based Routing**:
   - Regular users: Login → User Info → Route Selection
   - Admin users: Login → Admin Dashboard

#### Assignment Flow (Regular Users)
1. **User Information**: Collect Last Name and Unit (`user-info.html`), stored in `sessionStorage`.
2. **Home Page**: Display existing assignments (fetched from the server) or region selection (`home.html`).
3. **Route Selection**: Choose available routes by region (`routes.html`).
4. **Confirmation**: Review and confirm selections (`confirm-routes.html`).
5. **Completion**: Final assignment details with print option (`details.html`).

#### Session & Storage Management
- **`sessionStorage`**: Used for user authentication status and user information for the current session.
- **`database.json`**: A file on the server that provides persistent storage for all route assignments.

### Security & Data Integrity

#### Access Control
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Suitable for small organizational use with known users.
- **Session-Based Security**: Authentication status is tracked per browser session.
- **Role Separation**: Complete separation between volunteer and admin interfaces.

#### Data Persistence
- **Server-Side Storage**: All route assignment data is stored on the server in `database.json`.
- **API Endpoints**: The server provides API endpoints to ensure controlled access and modification of the data.
- **Assignment Integrity**: The backend logic prevents double-booking of routes.
- **Data Recovery**: The admin interface allows for the correction of assignment errors.
- **Export Capability**: Complete data export for backup and external use.
